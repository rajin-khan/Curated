## ⚠️ Critical Concerns & Red Flags

### 1. Privacy & Security Issues
- **Remote Human Operators:** NEO requires human operators to remotely control it for tasks it doesn't know, raising serious privacy concerns
- **In-Home Data Collection:** Operators may have access to video feeds and household layouts
- **Data Sharing:** Unclear how much data is collected and who has access
- **Always-On Cameras:** Dual cameras constantly monitoring your home
- **Microphone Array:** 4 microphones potentially always listening

### 2. Autonomy Claims vs. Reality
- **Not Fully Autonomous:** Despite marketing, NEO requires human operators for many tasks
- **"Expert Mode" is Teleoperation:** The "Expert Mode" is essentially remote human control, not AI autonomy
- **Learning Curve:** Capabilities expand "over time" - unclear timeline
- **Early Access Limitations:** Foundational autonomy only at launch

### 3. Design Controversy
- **Uncanny Valley:** Mouthless, fabric-covered face has received mixed reactions
- **Aesthetic Concerns:** Some users find the design unsettling or "stuffed doll-like"
- **Practical Questions:** How does a soft body handle heavy-duty cleaning?

### 4. Cost & Value Proposition
- **High Price Point:** $20,000 is a significant investment
- **Subscription Alternative:** $499/month = $5,988/year (still expensive)
