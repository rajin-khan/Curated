This video is sponsored by Bamboo Lab. So, my desk setup might not look like much. It's definitely more on the minimal side, but what you don't see are a bunch of carefully crafted features that are designed to basically be invisible to people visiting my apartment. There is hidden storage and functions everywhere. It almost feels like magic at this point. It all started a while ago when I spent a whole year designing the perfect drawer organizers. I created a whole system to make accessing the tools I use every single day as efficient as possible. This really inspired me to maximize not just the organization of my tools, but how I use my whole desk setup all together. This is part of my new dream setup series. So, if you have any ideas for what should be my next episode or what kind of upgrades I should do, drop them in the comments below. But for now, let's make this quick. Let's start with charging cables. I want them easily accessible but never in the way. The easiest way to accomplish this is to actually just buy one of these adhesive retractable charging cable thingies and use its adhesive back to just stick it under your desk. But I decided I wanted to use this other one instead. It's a wall plug, which is a bit annoying, but it's way cheaper and it also comes with a USB outlet. This will definitely be useful under my desk. A lot of these upgrades are going to require custom designs. So, for this video, I'll be trying out the new P2S 3D printer from Bamboo Lab. [Music] I then plugged in the short extension cable and now it's ready. This is especially handy here for tools that draw power over USBC, like my soldering iron. And when I'm done, I designed one for the back of my desk, too. That orients the plug so it's poking up instead to charge things on my desk like my keyboard. And when I'm done using it, that's it. But I don't want to charge my phone here. That would get in the way. So, I'm actually going to install this. It's actually designed for laptops initially, but still works. And the same is true for my AirPods. I don't want these just sitting around getting lost and not staying charged. Now, the new AirPods, they're actually MagSafe compatible. And what I learned is that the magnets are strong enough to charge these even upside down. So I think I know the perfect spot to hide these. [Music] With this gummy double-sided tape, I can mount this print on the back of my studio display without worrying about residue marks if I ever need to remove it. [Music] [Applause] [Music] The back of my monitor has this little crevice that perfectly fits my SD card and CFX Express Type A card reader. It's like it was made to be here. So, [Music] I love how subtle it looks, but now it just feels like I have this extra functionality built into my monitor stand. So, to show just how much I hate unnecessary things on my desk and how far I'm willing to go to maximize my usable space, I got this laptop stand a while back. I really like it, but instead of using it with the metal base plate it came with, I actually just ended up drilling into my desk. And even though this isn't a huge functional upgrade, I just love how clean it looks now. And I never have to worry about stuff getting in the way of my laptop stand. Ambient light is super important for any good desk setup to reduce eye strain, but to also make your space look cozy, which is exactly what I want my desk setup to be. So, I wanted to design my own lamp. With designing any kind of light, it's all about controlling where the light goes and does not go and using that path of light to showcase form. This can be kind of tricky with 3D printing because unless you're using very thick walls, in most cases, the light's just going to shine through all of the plastic. That's kind of why most 3D printed lamps end up having this similar look. The light is just kind of shining through all of it. I got nothing against that, but I realized with Bamboo Lab's AMS system, I can 3D print with multiple colors at the same time. The AMS2 Pro also has active heating and venting, making it a perfect system for keeping all my filament in the best condition possible. I can use this bone white filament for parts of the print I want less light to shine through, paired with black filament to fully block light from passing through those areas. [Music] [Music] I think this design may have been loosely inspired by a certain building I walk by every day. I left the top open in case the light bulb gets warm, but with LEDs, heat isn't really a problem. So, instead, I'll be diusing the light up here with a lid, which makes it the perfect spot for this little dude. [Music] So, when I catch myself working too hard, this little guy reminds me to slow down a bit. >> I don't want to reach back here to turn the lamp on and off all the time from the switch. So, I'll be using a huge smart bulb, making this a smart lamp, so I can control this lamp along with all the other lights in my apartment from a single switch. This switch is actually very important. You see the lights in my background. I have multiple colors and brightness presets set for these guys and along with all the lights in my apartment for different tasks that I'm doing. If I'm filming, they're at a pretty low brightness preset so it doesn't overexpose the camera. If I'm just hanging out or I have guests over, they're in this slightly brighter and warmer mode. If I'm trying to be hyperfocused on my desk, I use this super bright configuration. And there's this one, too. H that's not the point is I use this controller a lot. But my problem is not only does it go missing very often. It's once again another item that's occupying space on my desk. So while I was trying to figure out where to hide this button, I noticed the ambient light of my desk is now uneven. I wanted another lamp on this side of my monitor. And I realized what if that lamp could also be the controller for all my lights. [Music] The Hue smart switch can slide right into this track. So now when I click down on the lamp shade, not only does it turn on the lamp, but it also controls all the lights in my living room. I can tap on it multiple times to toggle between different presets and even use gestures to adjust the specific brightness. [Music] Okay, I don't know if anyone can relate to this next one, but I have a really weird need when it comes to using my iPad. I always need to have two cases handy for it. When I need to use it for writing scripts, I use the Magic Keyboard case. When I'm watching content, drawing on my iPad, or doom scrolling, I need the flexibility of this origami stand case. So, I made this. These shelves can now hold both of my iPad cases along with the iPad in either one of them. With the charging cable close by, it can also ensure my iPad stays charged. Okay, let's talk about cable management. Some people like to go full out with modular boards and fancy systems, and I totally get that. But for me, my needs are simple. I just want something that looks clean and makes it easy to route and hide all my cables quickly. And I've tried a track systems and shelves, but this is definitely the best solution I've tried so far. It can fit my entire power strip inside and it's super easy to install and it's basically shaped like a taco. I can unhook the front to open it up and I can route all the cables inside. What I love about is that it's got these Velcro straps for me to hold everything neatly, but it also gives me the flexibility to basically just shove everything inside very quickly and easily if I'm in a rush. And either way, once I close up the taco, it always looks tidy from the outside. And that's good enough for me. This next design starts with me pausing the print right at the start. I can embed some magnets into it. And then I let the rest of the print finish. Next is this bracket. And same thing, I need to embed some magnets here and then here as well. These ones can fall out easily though since it's not stuck to the print bed. So I'm using some more magnets to clamp them in place. The bracket mounts under my desk with this guide and the bin attaches magnetically underneath. The way this works is that there is now a red line indicator on my desk for where the garbage can is. And so I can just push trash off this part of my desk. If I have smaller debris or dust on my desk, this red part of the indicator actually snaps off, revealing a brush that I can then use to sweep things up. So this brush is actually fully 3D printed. I got inspired by one of those hairy lion thingies that people love 3D printing and realized that with a bit of bridging, I can use that same technique to make a perfectly functional brush. So, when I have a bunch of eraser bits, I can also take off the bin and use it like a dust pan. And when I'm done, they can both return to the bracket magnetically. So, most of the projects for my YouTube channel are made on my old 3D printer, Bamboo Labs X1C. It's just super reliable despite its crazy print speeds. I love its AI powered camera monitoring system, multiaterial printing. It's always been my favorite 3D printer to use. But now that there's the new P2S, what's wild is that even though it's a cheaper 3D printer than the X1C, it somehow comes with all of those features I just talked about and even more. Yeah, it has a new quick swap nozzle design and brighter dual lights inside the enclosure. So, before on the X1C, this is all you can see from the outside. But now with the P2S, visibility has been drastically improved. Look at that comparison. With the better lighting, recording time-lapses, and videos just look so much better now. Tons of amazing new features, but my favorite are these little handles on the sides. Revolutionary stuff. My most recommended budget beginner 3D printer is still the A1 Mini. But if you're looking for something that can get you larger prints and has an enclosed system, is quieter, faster, and can just take your projects even further, the P2S is all that. This machine is a beast, and at this price point, it's a no-brainer. So, check out the links below for more information about it. And thank you to Bamboo Lab for sponsoring this video. Now, let's move on to my Alex drawers. This is a classic piece of furniture from IKEA that's part of so many desk setups. My desk's main drawer is very efficiently organized, but these, not so much. I've always felt like I can get more out of the Alex drawers, but the annoying thing is the drawers don't even fully extend. It's hard to use it maximum potential when I can't even reach the things in the back of it. So, let's change that. [Music] feel. [Music] Hey [Music] Okay, so this is Scott from the future. And this is the thing. The design heavily relies on the metal track behind it to reinforce these walls and keep everything straight. I know this because there's a scene later on where I pulled out the drawers very carelessly while there's a lot of weight inside the drawer. So, of course, without the metal track supporting these walls, all the dovetails snapped. Now, the funny thing is, I didn't even notice this at first. I reinstalled everything and everything still worked fine. So, although I think PLA definitely works for this project, I decided to reprint everything anyway with some carbon fiber reinforced PET plastic just to be safe for long-term use. The P2S's enclosed design makes it way easier to print material like this, which require more stable temperature and better fume control. And now, this just feels so much more rigid compared to the original PLA prints. Anyway, this is definitely a more technical upgrade. So, if you want detailed video tutorials on this and how to assemble the lamps from earlier, download all the 3D printable files from this video, consider joining my YouTube channel membership to access those and even access some behind-the-scenes content. I'll leave some more details about this in the description below, but yeah, all this work just for three more inches. 3 in might not sound like much, but now I can reach places I couldn't before. So, did you know the Alex drawers were the exact width of six Goodfinity boxes? Yeah, it's perfect. Lengthwise, not so much, but it's good enough. So, I'll be using that to organize a few of my less frequently used tools. This one's for my camera lenses. Extra Mag Safe batteries, other equipment batteries, my camera monitor, and some lens adapters. For the rest of the space, I'll be using it to finally address a problem that's been bugging me for such a long time. These annoying containers come with any hardware you buy, and they're never the same size. They're just awful to use. Gridfinity bins are perfect for this. I can use the different color filament to label each bin with their hardware size. These bins are designed with a small ramp inside them, which makes taking things out very easy. [Music] Now that all the bolts are sorted, I wanted to take advantage of the extra height in the drawer. So, I made this. [Music] And I'll be using this for different type of nuts, washers, everything that goes on bolts basically with an extra bin for miscellaneous stuff. [Music] Okay, another popular IKEA piece that everyone loves using for organization is the Scatteris pegboard. I'm so jealous of all the cool DIY projects and organization setups people have used this for. But my problem is my office is in my living room and a pegboard, no offense, but no matter how you dress it, it's always going to look like a workshop organizer. And I really don't want that look in my living room. Now, there's a corner of my room I always end up hiding my messes. It's this area just behind my Alex drawers. I always pile my film equipment there because it's just kind of a blind spot. So, what if I was able to hide the pegboard right there? [Music] Now my Alex doors has the scatteris pegboard functions. I can use IKEA's metal pegboard hooks for carrying heavy film equipment or design my own accessories. [Music] So, since my cameras are very expensive, I need these holders to never unhook by accident. So, I'll be locking them in with this additional print. Now, they're not going anywhere. This next unique holder is for holding my camera battery chargers. [Music] And this other one is for holding my sliders battery charger. I needed to make the hole slightly larger to route these cables through, but now I can easily charge my batteries right by my desk whenever they die. After the batteries are charged, I need a way to keep them somewhere where they're easily accessible. Initially, I wanted to make something like this. Two long springs run through this. It's basically an auto expensing magazine. Once batteries are loaded in, it's ready to dispense. As satisfying and fun as this is, there are three gliding problems. One, because the spring needs a lot of room to compress, only half of this whole vertical height can be used to store the batteries. That's a lot of wasted space. And because the batteries are loaded in from the top, where it's also where they're dispensed, it means that over time the batteries at the very bottom will never get used. That's not good. And three, because the pegboard on the drawer faces away from my desk, grabbing them from the front actually doesn't make a lot of sense. They should ideally dispense from the side where I can then easily reach them from here. So, I rotated the dispenser and took out the springs. And now this is a much better solution. Batteries are loaded in from the very top and dispense out the bottom. [Music] The extra space underneath lets me add a second dispenser for my larger slider batteries. Now I can grab these batteries right from the front. All right. I've been living with these upgrades for a few months now and I got to say I love them all so much and I have so many more ideas now on how I want to continue evolving not just my desk setup but my other drawers and furniture and really my whole apartment. So, I really hope you follow along with this new series. It's wild how much a few thoughtful improvements can completely change the way your space feels. The changes might look small, but when little tedious tasks like grabbing my camera, getting a new battery, and cleaning up a mess, when these tasks go from being annoying to something that's actually fun and satisfying to do, something changes. The barriers between thinking and doing, they start to fade and you just start wanting to create. And when this place is where I sit down to work every single day, that makes all the difference. A well-designed setup doesn't just make work easier, it makes it feel better. And when work feels good, you show up more, you finish more, and you try more. That's why this matters. Thanks for watching. [Music]
