this video is sponsored by bamboo lab and made in collaboration with overwork so one of my favorite iPhone features is standby mode basically when you charge your iPhone horizontally it goes into this full screen clock experience with widgets and apps all designed for easy glance ability for example if I set a timer right now and put the phone in standby mode the whole screen displays the remaining time on my timer anyway a couple of days ago this music producer and artist named overwork hit me up with this idea to design an iPhone doc specifically for standby mode and what caught my attention is that he wanted to create this design based on an old product one from one of my favorite designers and actually one of Apple's biggest Inspirations Theodor ROMs if you're an artist or a designer and you don't know who this is you got some homework to do he's a German industrial designer who started working at Brun in 1955 almost 70 years ago but his work there completely revolutionized the way we thought about consumer products his influence on design technology ology and Manufacturing can still be seen everywhere around us he created this and then Akia made this he designed this son he made this even the ex- head of design at Apple Johnny I aluminium designed some of Apple's most iconic products using a lot of the same design language that deodor ROMs defined now in 1976 he designed this alarm clock the dn40 and this is the product overwork was inspired by he thinks this is the perfect form for an iPhone standby mode dock and uh he just sent me his design for the first prototype uh for this project I'll be using the A1 Mini 3D printer that bamboo lab just sent me I've wanted to try one of these for a while now the A1 series has been my go-to recommendation for beginners because of their features reliability print quality and affordability so let's put it to the test [Music] okay so here's the design that overal work has put together so far it holds a MAG safe charger which perfectly holds the iPhone in place within the body and now it's in standby mode perfect but I want to add a bit more to this design for starters taking out the iPhone can be a bit awkward since it's fully sitting inside this body there's no Edge you can grab onto overwork designed it so you can push in on one side of the iPhone which would pop out the other end he did this with these tilted walls beside the mefe charger but I feel like this interaction can be improved upon and you guys know how much I love um a satisfying ejection button so I want to work that into the design and next I also want to add in the back here an additional wireless charger for my airpods this way the back won't all just be decorative even though it have some functionality and I think that's it but before I print this I think uh my A1 Mini needs some customizations [Music] [Music] I'll be using an Apple Watch charger in the back because they're a lot smaller then I added some nonslip so they con adhesive strips to the bottom to act as [Music] feet and now it's ready the iPhone's in standby mode and I can charge my airpods in the back and when I want to grab my iPhone so this is what we're calling the iPhone dm40 dock and I love that it feels like an object from an alternate universe like as if in another timeline in the Multiverse somehow Braun and apple came together and had the opportunity to collaborate and they gave birth to this object even working on it I was talking to overwork and he said that it felt like a spiritual collaboration between not just him and I but also between Johnny IV and deodor ROMs a weird collaboration between the four of us that could have never actually happened so this iPhone dm40 Doc is our homage to one of our favorite products by one of our favorite designers the dock works best on your nightstand or at the corner of your desk allowing you to get the most out of Iphone standby mode and it looks great in other colors just like the original dm40 did if you're interested in 3D printing one of these for yourself this design for the iPhone 15 Pro will be free for download in the link below if you have another iPhone model I will also be releasing the project files for those of you who are comfortable with editing 3D models and fusion I might also make a tutorial for my channel members if you guys are interested but if you guys just want to buy one overwork was telling me that he might produce a few of these to sell so let us know in the comments if that's something you're interested in as well he is such a talented artist and musician he made all the great songs that were used in this video check out his music on YouTube and Spotify also linked below now at one point in De rams's career he asked himself The crucial question is my design good design to answer this he uh he developed his famous 10 principles of good design I thought I would grade bamboo Labs A1 Mini 3D printer using some of these principles one good design is innovative the way this printer can print with four different filaments at once at this price point using its AMS system is unlike anything I've seen on the market making it definitely Innovative two good design makes a product useful this printer's Auto calibration and bed leveling made the printer so easy to use right out of the box I was so impressed so yes definitely useful three good design is aesthetic well just look at this thing four good design makes a product understandable the user interface mobile app and desktop slicer are all super intuitive so yes seven good design is long lasting aside from being very durable bambo laap also sells most of all the parts you will ever need for basic repairs on its website eight good design is thorough down to the Last Detail I used to hate replacing my 3D printers nozzle it's scary tedious and risks print failure if you do it wrong but on the A1 Mini that's it it's too easy the designers definitely cared about every Last Detail 10 good design is as little design as possible this definitely feels like the most minimal design possible not just aesthetically but also in terms of How It's engineered it's small it's light and at this price point it's all very impressive so those are a few of theod rams' design principles and in conclusion I definitely consider this 3D printer a good design if you want to grab your own A1 Mini or check out the other amazing 3D printers from bamboo lab check out the links below and huge thank you to Bamboo lab for sponsoring this video anyway this project was so much fun to work on with over work it's not every day I get to design and brainstorm with another artist and we're so happy with how it turned out and also very excited to be sharing this design with you all if you make one please send us photos of it tag us on Instagram or shoot us photos in the DMS we would love to see it so yeah thanks for watching [Music] he [Music] [Applause] [Music]
