[Music] this is what I'm calling the Macintosh Studio it's an iPad Mini do on a Mac Studio with a few built-in features and uh here's why I made it one the Mac Studio takes up a lot of room on my desk it's really designed to sit under your monitor but I already have enough stuff under my monitor so this thing is just getting pretty annoying two completely unrelated but I've been wanting a dock for my iPad Mini currently I don't have it plugged in so whenever I need to use it its batteries are dead I also don't love the fact that since it's a portable device it's completely underutilized when I'm at my desk so ideally I can use it as a small external monitor instead of it just sitting there all the time and three weirdly enough the iPad Mini is the exact same width as the Mac studi so it's like they were destined to be brought together now what's hard about this project is really how bulky this thing is this thing is thick so I'm actually going to be taking inspiration from another very bulky design from Apple the first ever Mac they made one of my favorite classic designs the 1984 Macintosh hello I am Macintosh Macintosh the computer for the rest of us Macintosh the Apple Macintosh Mac step one brainstorm all right let's take a look so of course the iPad will be where this screen is and the Mac Studio will make up most of its base but then we have all this extra body and I don't want all that to to just be decorative so let's see what we can do with that space maybe the back opens and I can store pens in other stationary inside but then you'd have to open it just to grab a pen maybe there's slits down the body of this thing so it can hold paper and letters I don't really get letters what else could it hold what if there's cup holders big enough for Stanley tumblers even no I like the idea of it holding other things on my desk though timer charger what about my speakers or maybe it can help organize other Tech accessories like like maybe my headphones maybe it can hold my headphones or what are other things it can hold maybe external storage for my Mac Studio or maybe a whole raid system for all my hard drives and backup files probably won't fit what if the front had a removable magnetic plate that way I can have different plate designs that are interchangeable and they can work with different iPad models uh that's a bit much let's just start 3D modeling [Music] [Music] [Music] now my iPad can be used as an external monitor while staying fully charged and with this mini monitor in my peripherals it's great for putting on YouTube videos controlling Spotify when I'm working or for drawing up quick things with the apple pencil when I want to remove the iPad the bottom has an ejection button and it can also be used to lower the iPad in gently on the side there's a built-in holder for my headphones and the back drawer can be used for storing external ssds I also made another drawer design for holding my old hard drive so now I can keep all my old project backups easily accessible I couldn't help myself but also take a little bit of inspiration from the old color ful iMac g3s and print one of these in color too I still prefer the white for this but the color does contrast the cold aluminum pretty well and I can imagine this looking pretty good in other colors now because this stand design fits over the Mac Studio and the Mac Studio actually has the same top Dimensions as the Mac Mini it means this design can be easily tweaked to work with the Mac Mini I still need to figure out how the iPad ejection button and the other features will work with a smaller form factor but it should be pretty straightforward to to tweak the design so if you guys are interested in the version of this for the Mac Mini let me know in the comments but in the meantime if you want to 3D print your own Macintosh Studio or modify this design for your own needs check out my membership below to access all the project files I just launched this membership and I'll be sharing all my project files there from now on including the files for past projects like the 3D printed draw organizers that a lot of you guys have been asking for those will be up next month they're almost ready I just got to clean up the files a bit before they're ready to be shared but if you join today you'll also get access to exclusive design and 3D modeling tutorials let's design a customized drawer for the Macintosh Studio let's design some custom drawer organizers starting with this module for holding your SD cards at USB director's commentary for this video will also be up soon tap the join button below to learn more about my membership but uh yeah some of you guys might remember this but I've actually been sitting on this Macintosh Studio idea since the portable Mac Mini video and it's just one of those projects that I had to materialize in order to move on because it's been on my mind for way too long but how perfect is it that I would get this done finally this year because this year also happens to be the 40th anniversary of the original Macintosh sadly this isn't actually the original this is the um the classic 2 which was the only one I could get my hands on but fun fact about the original model Steve Jobs saw the original Macintosh like it was an art piece so if you P it open you can actually find the original team members names as well as his own embossed into the enclosure pretty cool right so I meant to put this video out sooner but I'm actually in the process of moving apartments right now so it's been pretty busy but uh you know this was a heavily requested project in the comments so I hope you guys enjoyed it because I really enjoyed designing this thing and putting the video together using the new 3D printer and everything my next video will probably be for my new apartment and so so I hope I'll see you guys there I already started working on the script for that video and I'm pretty excited it's it's actually been like 10 years in the making and it's this you know what actually no spoilers that's all I'll say for now I hope I'll see you guys there so yeah thanks for watching girl I [Music] but I can never [Music]
