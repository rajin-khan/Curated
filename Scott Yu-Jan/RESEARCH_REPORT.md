# Scott Yu-Jan: Comprehensive Research Report

## Executive Summary

Scott Yu-Jan is a product designer and YouTube creator who has built an audience of over 820,000 subscribers by creating content that seamlessly blends professional design expertise with accessible DIY projects. Born in Seattle in 1994, Scott brings real-world product design experience from Google and Amazon to his YouTube channel, where he creates custom hardware solutions, 3D printing projects, and workspace optimizations that are both functional and beautiful.

What sets Scott apart in the crowded maker/tech YouTube space is his unique combination of professional design credentials, authentic problem-solving, and a deep appreciation for design history.
