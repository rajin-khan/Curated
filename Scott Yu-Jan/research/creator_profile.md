Scott started his YouTube channel in November 2012, initially focusing on tech product creations and design projects. His channel tagline is simple and authentic: **"i like making art and design stuff"** - reflecting his genuine passion rather than trying to be overly commercial.

His journey from product designer at major tech companies to full-time content creator represents a shift toward creative independence. In his video "leaving Google for this" (281K views), he documented his decision to leave Google to pursue YouTube full-time, showing the courage to prioritize creative fulfillment over corporate stability.

## Mission & Vision

Scott's mission appears to be about **democratizing design and making**. He consistently emphasizes:

1. **Getting more out of things you already own** - Repurposing and maximizing existing products
2. **Making weird solutions to unique problems** - Embracing unconventional approaches
3. **The intersection of art and technology** - Blending aesthetics with functionality
4. **Teaching through doing** - Sharing the entire design process, including failures

His philosophy is captured in his own words: *"isn't this the point of being a maker that we can make weird solutions to our own very unique problems"*

## Design Philosophy

Scott's design approach is heavily influenced by:
- **Dieter Rams** - German industrial designer, Braun (mentioned explicitly in iPhone Dock video)
- **Jonathan Ive** - Former Apple head of design
- **Apple's design language** - Clean, minimal, functional aesthetics

He applies Rams' "10 Principles of Good Design" to evaluate products and his own work, showing deep respect for design history and principles.
