so pewdiepie gave my last youtube video a shout 
out and now cool twitch streamers are watching   my videos on their stream i'm also about 
to hit a hundred thousand subscribers so   a lot of exciting stuff but anyways this is 
a weird project there's not really a demand   for this one it's just something that's 
been bothering me for a long time so   yeah let me explain you see i hate laptops so much 
back in school i used to carry around a freaking   fan just to keep my laptop from overheating i 
had to carry this phone with me everywhere and   it was awful and even now in 2022 i still need 
to keep a fan under my work laptop to keep it   cool when i'm running heavy things i feel like 
laptops just aren't very reliable i've had to   replace so many batteries other components 
and eventually they always stopped working   and that's why i love my mac mini m1 this thing 
is very affordable crazy good performance i do   all my youtube video editing on these and it 
never overheats but the problem is of course   i can't take it everywhere with me 
and i'm surprised by the fact that   nobody has really taken advantage of how 
small it is and made it more portable i mean   people have tried but their approach 
just didn't look very practical to me so so i like to start with what i call a 
visual vomit so the goal is to get all   the ideas out of your head as quickly as 
possible without being too critical now i   know drawing on a blank piece of paper can 
be really intimidating so i like to use a   whiteboard marker on my monitor with 
the help of some pictures so what if what if it was like a macintosh and i just 
built a display directly on the mac mini but   the mac mini would somehow need to be detachable 
so what if it was like a vhs player but instead of   inserting vhs tapes you insert the mac mini maybe 
it's like the game boy actually where you have a   keyboard and a screen and the mac mini plugs 
in the backside kind of like a game cartridge   a bit too bulky um maybe it works with a usb 
hub and the mac mini is actually sandwiched in   the middle with a screen and the screen's angle 
can be adjusted or maybe to keep it simple it's   just like a laptop form if i don't like how 
an idea turns out i can quickly erase them   and if i like something i can easily alright 
now we do some more detailed drawings now initially i was designing this thing to work 
with one of those hdmi monitors that i've used   in the past but then when i was drawing on my 
ipad mini i noticed the ipad mini is actually   the exact same width as the mac midi like 
they were made for each other it's perfect so and that's pretty much it a usb to usbc 
cable can be held in place and protected   add some finishing touches and there's also a slot in the back to 
store the power cable now i usually keep   this thing hanging under my desk and then 
when i need to leave to go work somewhere and when i get to where i need to 
work it's pretty quick to set up using a cabled connection the duet app can 
support full retina resolution completely offline   it also supports touch screen capabilities 
so i don't need to carry a mouse with me and it's actually pretty intuitive to use i 
can adjust the screen's angle to whatever is   comfortable and if it's ever loose i can grab 
the allen key stored on the side and tighten   things up as needed so if you can't tell i really 
like this thing i've been doing more traveling   recently and i bring this thing with me everywhere 
in fact i edited a portion of this video in canada   in a coffee shop with my family all using 
this setup so that was pretty cool i know a   lot of people are gonna say like why not just 
buy a laptop this is silly but like i said i   hate laptops and isn't this the point of being 
a maker that we can make weird solutions to our   own very unique problems so yeah i know it's not 
for everybody but i'm personally psyched to keep   using this thing anyways if you didn't notice 
from the very subtle product placement earlier   i have merch now if you want to support my channel 
check them out in the links below there's only a   few products right now but i got a lot more coming 
soon i've been designing everything myself working   really hard with manufacturers making sure all 
the stuff is high quality so please check it out   in this video i tried to show a little bit more of 
my design process a lot of the behind the scenes   stuff usually that stuff i don't include because 
i find it personally kind of boring and too   educational but let me know in the comments below 
if you guys like that do you guys want to see more   design process stuff or less i personally think it 
can get boring but that's just my opinion and uh   yeah it's been really busy i've also been trying 
to spend more time with my friends and family and   a lot of the freehand shots you saw in this video 
were actually only possible because my dad was   able to film a bunch of them for me it was a lot 
of fun working with him and yeah huge thank you   to my family for helping me with this video also 
huge thank you to the donators this time we got   viorell ianescu kian dowd thank you for the kind 
words ian bullard terry shu and chun chen thank   you all so much for the support and uh that's 
pretty much everything thanks for watching guys so you
