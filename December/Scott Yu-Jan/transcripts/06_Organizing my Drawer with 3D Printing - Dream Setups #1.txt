Hey, guys. So it's always been very important to me
that when I need to get to work, I can get to work as quickly as possible. But the problem is,
even when I know exactly which SD card it is that I'm looking for
and exactly where it is, I still have to... [digging through drawer sounds] With everything properly arranged. The USBs are even accessible now
without the need to fully open the drawer. So this
this is actual organization, right? Because existing organizers
don't organize your stuff. They just kind of divide up your stuff
into smaller units of mess. So... After roughly laying out the main objects in their placements, 
I took a photo of it for reference. I also took reference photos
of some of the objects individually with rulers when I needed their detailed
dimensions for tracing. This one's for my sticky notes. and remember those hotel cards
that I like using as small whiteboards? Those go in here. Pens I don't use often will go
in this bottom section, and for the pens I use often... it holds my main sharpie,
ballpoint pen,  and dry erase marker My nail clippers and lip balm with some storage below for refills. Of course, I can't have a perfect holder
for everything. There will always be
miscellaneous stuff, so... This grid holds my dry erase marker refills and other miscellaneous knives. My favorite Magsafe Chargers. I want easily accessible,
but yeah, they don't quite fit. If they're slightly slanted
though they fit so So, everything so far has been pretty 
focused on organization, right? But I wanted a few modules
to have some extra functionality. So this next one... Not only is this a lid that holds
my screwdriver but it can also double as a project tray on my desk for loose screws and parts
when I'm disassembling stuff For this next print, there's a hole in the back for magnet
which can be sealed with some hot glue. This helps the scissors lock into place. Right. Shoutout to the sponsor today, Ugreen. They just sent me their line of Nexode chargers
and I am in love with these things. First up,
we have the Nexode Mini 45W charger. The charger that came with my iPad
is about the same size, but it's only 20W. Ugreen’s is more than double
that at 45W and it has two USB-Cs so you can fast
charge two devices at the same time and then one size up, we have the Ugreen Nexode 65W charger. Apple's equivalent of this is once again
way bigger and it only has one port Ugreen’s has a nice compact design
with three ports, two USB-Cs and an USB-A. And lastly, we got the big one. The Ugreen Nexode 100W charger. This is the full powerhouse. It can charge my iPhone three times
faster than the original iPhone charger. It adjusts power output
to safeguard your devices and it's also got a super durable shell
that's designed for heat dissipation. My favorite feature on all of these however, is the fact that the prongs all
fold in for easy packing and storing. So there you have it, three super functional
and just beautiful looking chargers. Whatever devices you have, these
have you covered. So check out Ugreen’s
nexode chargers in the links below and huge thank you to Ugreen
for sponsoring this portion of the video. Let's get back to the drawers. So in case you haven't noticed, most
of the prints done so far has no bottoms. It's a bit more obvious on black. They also start with very sparse infill and only gets denser the higher it goes up where more supports and needed. These all contribute to reducing the amount of plastic used and of course
the printing time for each of these parts. So this is for a batteries, point-and-shoot, and microphone cable. For my electric screwdriver, precision screwdriver, deburring tool, and caliper. The last two modules
work together to hold a few things. First, the long ruler,
more Sony batteries Sony microphone, and my
favorite tape measure. Vinyl weeding tool and these tiny scissors. A hardware bin for miscellaneous hardware. And last but definitely not least,
I wanted to include some of these holders
for organizing screwdriver bits. But I realized,
I kind of hate these things. The bits are always hard to remove
and put back in. They're actually pretty annoying to use. So here's what I came up with instead. So now I can grab the bits
I need very easily. I can grab them on their own
or take the whole row to use on my desk. To avoid clutter, I can also stick them to the front of
my drawers since of course, they're magnetic. So, if you're interested in
doing a project like this here are a few things to keep in mind. For starters,
you don't have to start from scratch. There are a lot of really cool
organization systems online like Gridfinity which are open source
and have a lot of different modules already designed, openly available,
and completely free. Secondly, consider how you
might maximize vertical space. My organizer designs here
allow the drawers to hold significantly more items than what it used to with all the items just laying flat. And lastly,
arrange the items in a hierarchy. I have the stuff that I use the most accessible at the very front,
followed by the less important stuff and the longer items
that can reach all the way to the back. This ensures that the back of the drawer
is being fully utilized as well. So I worked on this project
almost throughout all of 2022. It's the kind of project that you just
know would take way too much of your time. In fact, I actually put it off for a long time
until I started to treat it as productive. productive procrastination. Basically, every time I would get bored
with another project or when something is taking way too long, I would open this project
and just kind of slowly chip away at it. It was a lot easier to work on
with no deadlines and no stress, so it was nice to consistently feel a sense of accomplishment
every time I finished another module. So even though I was procrastinating
from my other projects, I was also being productive
in a way. it was so worth it too, because this is definitely
one of my favorite projects in a while. This has changed
so much about how I use my drawer when I need to grab something
I don't even really need to look anymore. Like, here's my point-of-shoot, here's my phone battery,
here's my dry erase marker. Isn't that awesome? I even started thinking about
maybe doing this for other disorganized stores in my life,
like maybe my kitchen utensil drawer? Sometimes I do wonder
if maybe this is a bit too much, though. But then I look at it and it's just so beautiful. So yeah, I guess since I like it a lot
and I made it for myself, I guess that's enough, right? Thanks for watching, everyone.
